# Wordle

Wordle is a web-based word guessing game built using ReactJS and JavaScript. The game is designed to test your vocabulary and guessing skills by trying to guess a hidden word using a limited number of guesses.

## How to Play

1. When the game loads, you will see a row of blank squares, which represent the hidden word.
2. Below the hidden word, you will see a set of letter buttons.
3. Click on the letter buttons to guess a letter in the hidden word.
4. If the letter is in the hidden word, it will appear in the correct square(s). If the letter is not in the hidden word, you will lose a guess.
5. You have six guesses to correctly guess the hidden word. If you are unable to guess the word in six attempts, you lose the game.
6. If you correctly guess the hidden word within six attempts, you win the game!
